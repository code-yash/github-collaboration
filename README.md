# GitHub Collaboration - College Assignment

## Description

This repository is part of a college assignment related to GitHub collaboration. It contains code for various encryption and decryption algorithms and a main program that allows you to interact with these algorithms.

## Encryption and Decryption Algorithms

The repository includes the following encryption and decryption algorithms:

- Caesar Cipher
- Keyword Cipher
- PlayFair Cipher
- RailFence Cipher
- ElGamal Cipher

## Getting Started

To use the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile and run the `main.c` program to interact with the encryption and decryption algorithms.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to encrypt and decrypt messages using the chosen algorithm.

## Usage

Detailed instructions on how to use the code can be found in the `main.c` file and the comments within individual algorithm files.
